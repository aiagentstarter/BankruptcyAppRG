# Daily Changes - March 20, 2024

## Overview
Today's work focused on improving the Azure App Service deployment configuration for the Bankruptcy Application. The changes ensure proper deployment and runtime configuration for the Flask application on Azure App Service.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Verification
- Confirmed the presence of all required files in the root directory:
  - `app.py`
  - `requirements.txt`
  - `deploy.sh`
  - `templates/` directory with HTML files
- Verified Flask app object definition in `app.py`

### 2. Added Static Directory
- Created `static/` directory for future CSS and JavaScript files
- Added subdirectories:
  - `static/css/`
  - `static/js/`

### 3. Azure App Service Deployment Improvements

#### a. Added startup.sh
- Created `startup.sh` with Gunicorn configuration
- Set proper permissions (executable)
- Content:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0 --timeout 600 app:app
  ```

#### b. Updated requirements.txt
- Added Gunicorn dependency:
  ```
  gunicorn==21.2.0
  ```
- Maintained existing dependencies:
  - flask==2.3.3
  - azure-storage-blob==12.17.0
  - azure-ai-formrecognizer==3.2.1
  - azure-identity==1.13.0
  - azure-keyvault-secrets==4.7.0
  - python-dotenv==1.0.0

#### c. Enhanced deploy.sh
- Added startup command configuration
- Updated script to include:
  ```bash
  # Configure startup command
  az webapp config set \
    --name bankruptcyapp \
    --resource-group BankruptcyAppRG \
    --startup-file "startup.sh"
  ```

### 4. GitHub Repository Updates
- Committed all changes to the main branch
- Push successful to https://github.com/aiagentstarter/BankruptcyAppRG
