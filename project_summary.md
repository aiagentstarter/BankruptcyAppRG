# Bankruptcy Application Project Summary

## Project Overview
Created a Flask-based web application for bankruptcy document processing, integrating various Azure services for secure document handling and AI-powered analysis.

## Azure Resources Used
- **Key Vault (bankruptcyappvault)**
  - Stores sensitive credentials
  - Contains secrets: DIKey, BlobConnectionString
- **Blob Storage (bankruptcyappstorage)**
  - Containers: client-uploads, attorney-processed
  - Used for document storage
- **Document Intelligence (BankruptcyAppDI)**
  - AI-powered document analysis
- **App Service (bankruptcyapp)**
  - Hosts the web application
  - Python 3.9, Linux
  - Free F1 tier
- **App Service Plan (bankruptcyappplan)**
  - Linux-based
  - Free F1 tier

```

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Client Portal**
   - Secure document upload interface
   - Case ID-based organization
   - Support for PDF, DOC, DOCX formats
   - Direct upload to Azure Blob Storage

2. **Attorney Dashboard**
   - Client management system
   - Document viewing interface
   - AI-powered document processing
   - Results storage and viewing

3. **Security Features**
   - Azure Key Vault integration
   - Secure credential management
   - Role-based access control
   - SAS token-based blob access

4. **Database Schema**
   ```sql
   -- Clients table
   CREATE TABLE clients (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
       name TEXT,
       case_id TEXT,
       email TEXT
   )

   -- Files table
   CREATE TABLE files (
       id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
       client_id INTEGER,
       blob_name TEXT,
       upload_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       FOREIGN KEY(client_id) REFERENCES clients(id)
   )
   ```

## Development Steps Completed
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Created project structure
   - Set up virtual environment
   - Installed required dependencies
   - Configured Azure CLI

2. **Application Development**
   - Implemented Flask application
   - Created HTML templates with modern UI
   - Integrated Azure services
   - Set up database schema

3. **Azure Integration**
   - Connected to Key Vault
   - Set up Blob Storage access
   - Integrated Document Intelligence
   - Configured App Service settings

4. **Deployment**
   - Created deployment script
   - Configured environment variables
   - Deployed to Azure App Service

## Access Information
- **Client Portal**: https://bankruptcyapp.azurewebsites.net/client
  - Username: client
  - Password: clientpass

- **Attorney Dashboard**: https://bankruptcyapp.azurewebsites.net/attorney
  - Username: attorney
  - Password: password123

## Future Improvements
1. Implement proper user authentication and authorization
2. Add database backup to Blob Storage
3. Move App Service to East US region for reduced latency
4. Migrate to Azure SQL Database for better scalability
5. Add more document processing features
6. Implement client email notifications
7. Add document version control
8. Implement audit logging

## Testing Procedures
1. **Client Portal Testing**
   - Login functionality
   - Document upload
   - Case ID validation
   - File format validation

2. **Attorney Dashboard Testing**
   - Client management
   - Document viewing
   - AI processing
   - Results display

## Maintenance Notes
- SQLite database is local to App Service instance
- Blob Storage containers need periodic cleanup
- Monitor Key Vault access and rotation
- Check App Service logs for issues
